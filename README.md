# JTACTab: Advanced Support Module RE-WRITE

Remastered for Arma 2023 to carry on the work done by "LifeReapr".
Original author is "Sushi", big thanks for making this all those years ago.

## Description

* Introducing the JTAC Tab Re-Write for ArmA 3 – your advanced JTAC system. This latest version allows you to efficiently request close air support from both fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as set up rotary-wing transport missions complete with escort if necessary. Take control as the JTAC, specify the ideal IP (Initial Point)/BP (Battle Position), mark friendly locations, set your abort code and choose the munitions for your CAS mission. 

* JTAC Tab mirrors real-world CAS and TRANS requests within the limitations of the engine. Just like in real-life scenarios, when you mark a target with smoke, you'll need to confirm the smoke color when the pilot requests it. While staying true to the spirit of the original mod, a few details have been thoughtfully adjusted, created, and are being developed for the best JTAC mod on the workshop.

* JTAC TAB is also easy to use for mission makers. There are 4 modules to put and synchronize on the map. You can just “place and play”, as well as adjust each CAS parameters for your own. You can customize your airframe selections to pre-defined choices or a custom class.
